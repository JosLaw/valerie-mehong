## Features
 ### Navigation
Nav bar is fixed to viewpoint so as the user scrolls, it will remain in view at all times. To differeniate it from the background, it has a slightly translucient background colour with light text. When curser/mouse hovers over any of the sections, the background and text colour changes to signify which section you have selected. Each navigation title is a link to the named page.

 ### Header
The header contains the name of the artist for whom the website is for. This is fixed to the viewpoint across all pages. The writing is larger in a light colour to make it stand out from the black banner style background colour of the block. 

 ### Shop Locations
Embedded google maps have been placed on the page along with the written address of the tattoo studios. The maps are interactive and will open to full size on a new tab when clicked.

 ### Gallery
Pictures of the artist's work has been presented within scrolling galleries. One gallery showcases Japanese style work, whereas the other gallery showcases work in other styles. The user can scroll through the gallery by moving the cursor onto the gallery and dragging it left or right. There is also a scroll bar underneath the galleries to assist with the scroll function.

 ### Contact
A form has been created on the contact page for tattoo enquires. All of the boxes must have input in order to submit. It inclues a variety of input options including email to ensure a standard format email address is entered, radio buttons for colour, free text with drop down suggestions for placement, and a larger free text box for description.
